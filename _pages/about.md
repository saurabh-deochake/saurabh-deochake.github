I currently work as a Tech Lead and Staff Site Reliability Engineer at Twitter in Boulder, Colorado. Previously, I worked with companies like Societe Generale, Intel, and NTT Data. Apart from my work, I am actively working on solving problems in multi-party intelligent negotiation in Multi-agent Systems. 

Although I live in Boulder, I also call Toronto as my home. In my free time, I am either out on a road trip or hiking in and around Colorado.
